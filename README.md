Original description:


Washing dishes sucks.
​
If I was spending time practicing how to play a musical instrument as much as I am washing dishes, I could have a concert tomorrow in a cool place. 
I'm already annoyed, but what can my mother say, let alone my grandma? 

And now, when somebody asks me if know how to make music, I cannot answer  "mmm.... no, I can't do it... but, look, I ate from clean dishes in the past 9 years... that's also impressive..."
​
No... I will make music. With the dishes.
